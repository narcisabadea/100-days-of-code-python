# REST = REpresentational State Transfer

REST is an architectural style for designing APIs (other styels: SOAP, GraphQL, FALCOR etc)

It's based on the idea that all websites across the web would use the same structure for building APIs.

If every Web API was built using the same common guiding principles, then it would be so easy for everybody
to work together and be able to use different APIs quickly, easily, and efficiently.

The two most important rules are:

- using the HTTP request verb (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE - which are similar to databases CRUD operations)
- using a specific pattern of routes and endpoint URLs
