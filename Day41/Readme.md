How does the internet work

- the internet is a long piece of wire and the wire connects different computers to each other so they can talk to each other and transfer data through this giant wire.
- they have to be online 24/7 ready to serve you all of the data and the files that you are requesting when you try to access websites and the computers that are doing that job, we would call a server and the computers that any user would you use to access the internet is called a client.

- let's say that you're sitting at home on your computer and you type in google.com
- what happens behind the scenes is that your browser will send a message to your internet service provider (these are the people who you pay to be able to access the internet.)
- now the message that you're sending the ISP is I want to see google.com and the ISP will then relay that message to something called a DNS server (a domain name system server).
- and what happens when you make that request through your browser is the DNS server will look up in its database as to what is the exact IP address of that website that you are trying to access.
- And every single computer that's connected to the internet has an IP address.
- each computer can be located by their unique IP address.
- And once the DNS server finds the IP address, it sends that back to your browser. So now, you knowthe exact address where you can find the Google homepage.
- The next thing that happens is you will send a direct request to that address through your internet service provider. And this message will be delivered via what's called the internet backbone.
- And if you head over the submarinecablemap.com, you can view all of the underwater cables that power the internet. And the internet is made up of these huge sprawling masses of wires connecting all of the world's internet users.
- As you can imagine, it's a pretty complex world out there. Now, if I'm sitting in London and I want to see a website that's hosted in the United States, then my browser would have to make a request that goes through one of these cables under the Atlantic ocean in order to reach the United States.
- And once that computer has received my request, they'll send back all of the relevant data, again, through these giant cables. And to navigate all of this crazy underwater and above water wires, all I have is an IP address.
- So once I've gotten the IP address of the website that I want to access, then my browser sends another message through the internet service provider via the internet backbone to the server that is located at that address 216.58 210.46.
- And the computer that's located at that address is of course the Google server.
- And on the server there's all of the files that I would need in order to be able to view the Google homepage.
- The server then sends all of those files back to me through the internet backbone and I get to see the Google homepage in my browser. And all of that happens in a matter of milliseconds.

How do website work

- in order to access a webpage, we all know that you need a browser.
- These are all pieces of software that allow you to look up the IP address of your website and be able to receive data that it can render into websites.
- data that you receive from the server usually consists of three types of files; HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The HTML code file is responsible for the structure of your website.
- the second type of file are CSS files and these files are responsible for styling your website.
- the final component is the JavaScript code. And this is the code that allows your website to actually do things or have behavior.
- So if we take the Google website as an example again, once we receive these files from Google server, when our browser loads up the HTML files, we'll get to see the structure of the website, namely, there's one image which has their logo, there's two buttons, and there's a text box where we can enter our search.
- Now, when we receive the CSS files, then that will modify the appearance of all of those components. We don't have any more buttons or any more images, but the now look the way that Google wanted it to.
- And finally, when we incorporate the JavaScript files, then our website actually starts having behavior. It has functionality and it's actually able to do something rather than just display some images and texts to us. Now,
