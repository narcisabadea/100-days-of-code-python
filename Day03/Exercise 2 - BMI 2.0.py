# Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

# Under 18.5 they are underweight
# Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
# Over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
# Over 30 but below 35 they are obese
# Above 35 they are clinically obese.

# Example Input
# weight = 85
# height = 1.75
# Example Output
# 85 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 27.755102040816325
# Your BMI is 28, you are slightly overweight.
