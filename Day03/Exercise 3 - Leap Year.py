# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice:

# e.g. The year 2000:
# 2000 รท 4 = 500 (Leap)
# 2000 รท 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
# 2000 รท 400 = 5 (Leap!)
# So the year 2000 is a leap year.

year = int(input("Which year do you want to check? "))

if year % 4 == 0:
  if year % 100 == 0:
    if year % 400 == 0:
      print("Leap year.")
    else:
      print("Not leap year.")
  else:
    print("Leap year.")
else:
  print("Not leap year.")
